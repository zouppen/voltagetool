A working tool. This is a piece of crappiness.

Thanks

Idea and some code I got from:

Thank you ROS. I'd like to see you to do Linux kernel driver for
it. But I may do it some day if I've got enough time.

Thanks to Minibox for the original Windows sources, too. It would have
been very tricky to do voltage conversions without the original
implementation
